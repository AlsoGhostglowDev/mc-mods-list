## How to install
### Downloading for the first time
1. To install a specific modpack, use this [tool](https://download-directory.github.io/) to only download one specific folder.
2. After that's done, copy the link that redirects to the folder in the github repository. (e.g. `https://github.com/AlsoGhostglowDev/mc-mods-list/tree/main/create-fabric` for create-fabric).
3. Paste that in the input text box in the tool's website. <br>

4. Once your download completes, unzip the file and you should find two folders named `main` and `performance` (except for `create`). Put all the mods from both folders in your mods folder located at `AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/mods`.
5. To access such folder, use <kbd>WINDOWS + R</kbd> and put in <kbd>%appdata%</kbd>.
6. Start up minecraft with the version said in [modlist.md](https://github.com/AlsoGhostglowDev/mc-mods-list/blob/main/modlist.md) and the recommended platform version.
